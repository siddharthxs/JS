/*
   prefer not to use var 
   because of issue in block scope and functional scope 

*/

/* we have to remember one more thing that in javascript we can declare a variable by not putting var before it.
although we should not do that beccuse it may create problem  further.*/

/* in js using semicolon is not necessary its totally your choice wether you want to use it or not*/
